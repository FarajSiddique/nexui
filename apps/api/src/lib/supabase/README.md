# Supabase

Server-side Supabase code. Never import this directory from the mobile app or the
shared contracts package.

- `clients.ts`: cached clients without sessions. `getAuthClient()` uses the
  publishable key; `getAdminClient()` uses `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY` and bypasses
  row-level security, so it's only for admin actions such as account deletion, the AI run
  worker and the shared place media cache and its photo bucket (after the route has loaded the
  caller's own plans).
  `getUserClient(accessToken)` also uses the publishable key but sends the user's
  token, so Postgres row-level security limits every query to that user's rows.
  Use it for all user data.
- `verify-request.ts`: `verifyRequest(request, headers)` checks the
  `Authorization: Bearer` access token with `auth.getClaims()`. With ES256 signing
  keys this is checked locally against the project's cached JWKS. It returns
  `{ userId, email, accessToken }`, a 401 for a missing, invalid or expired token, or a 503 when
  Supabase is unreachable or not configured.

Copy the API's `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the `SUPABASE_*` values.
